<to be read again>
                   \relax
l.379 \setlength\ecart{1.2cm-\esp}

A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)

/home/donghoonpark/Projects/Latex/project01_ros_documentation/structure.tex:379: Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).
<to be read again>
                   \relax
l.379 \setlength\ecart{1.2cm-\esp}

Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
